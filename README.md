# Implementation of Useful Algorithms in Python

Working through this page, creating my own implementations of the algorithms based on their descriptions and validating them:

### Testing

This project is supported by a complete unit testing suite using pytest. Simply run `pytest` in terminal to run. All tests within the cwd and sub-directories will run.

Tags:
- `pytest -v` - increased verbosity for individual test output.
- `pytest -s` - stdout capturing turned off (print statements from tests and original scripts will show).
- `pytest --cov` - will run pytest, and provide a code coverage report at the end.
